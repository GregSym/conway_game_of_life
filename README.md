# conway_game_of_life

Does what it says on the lid. It's Conway's Game of Life, done in a way that is, as best as I can tell, super inefficient.

So probably don't copy my implementation, but because this is very surface level Flutter stuff it should be buildable for most platforms.

I've tested:

<li>Chrome</li>
<li>Android Q</li>
